#### Chapter 4 - Accurate Self-Assessment

-

* We must strive for exellency. We must shoot for a level of proficiency that we haven't yet imagined.

#### Be The Worst

**Context**

* You have *Unleashed Your Enthusiasm* and have outgrown your team.

**Problem**

* Your rate of learning has leveled off.

**Solution**

* Surround yourself with talented people. As you build *Breakable Toys* you can
test how much you've been picking up from *Rubbing Elbows* with them.
* By being the worst in the team doesn't mean you're not doing you're job,
it means you're putting your most effort and energy at getting better at the craft.
You don't want to slow down your team and/or put your job in jeopardy.

**Action**

* List all the teams you know. Include open source projects,
other departments, and other companies. Sort these teams by skill level,
then identify a team that is open to new members who want to work their way up.
This will give you an idea of your skill level.

#### Find Mentors

**Context**

* You started the journey of software development and have explored some blind alleys.

**Problem**

* You're not sure what the next step is, you need guidance.

**Solution**

* *Ideally*, you will find a master craftsman who will accept you as an apprentice.
* Reach out to someone you admire, see if you can meet atleast once a month.
This will give you a head start in what you need to do next.

**Action**

* Pick a tool, library, or a community that has an active mailing list.
Sign up to the list, but don't post any messages yet.
Just observe who is patient in responding to the questions.
When the next meetup or conference happens, try to connect with them,
and ask for informal advices they've learned.

#### Kindred Spirits

**Context**

* You find yourself discouraged by the cultured of your development organization.

**Problem**

* Organizational cultures that encourages software craftsmaship are rare. You find yourself stranded without mentors.

**Solution**

* In lack of mentorship, you need to find people that are also willing to excel.

**Action**

* Look for groups in your area to attend to. If no groups are available, here's your ticket to starting one.

#### Sweep the Floor

**Context**

* You are a new apprentice on a project

**Problem**

* You're not sure of your place on the team and your team isn't sure of you.

**Solution**

* Volunteer for simple, unglamorous, yet necessary, tasks.

**Action**

* What's the lamiest task that your team has been putting off for months? Tackle it.
And don't just hold your nose and force yourself to do it; see if you can creatively
resolve the problem in a way that exceeds people's expectations and makes it fun for you.
