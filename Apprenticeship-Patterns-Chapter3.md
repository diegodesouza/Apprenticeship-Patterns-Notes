Chapter 3. Walking the Long Road

* When we think we have reached a place of where we know something there is something new to be discovered. 

#### The Long Road

* Learning to be a good programmer is a life long task. It involves a lot more than just typing. 

**Context**

* There's a new wave of developers, and we seem to be making the same mistakes from the beginning of ages. 

**Problem**

* You want to become a better developer, yet conventional wisdom tells you to take the highest-paying job and the first promotion available. 
* Becoming a master takes time. 

**Solution**

* Value learning and long term growth opportunities over salary. 
* Set goals and work torwards that goal. We become what we do today. 

**Action**

* Imagine where you want to be, choose a path, calculate the risks, and act on it. 

#### Craft over Art

**Context**
 
* You're being paid to program

**Problem**

* The problem will be challenging enough to exercise your problem solving skills.

**Solution**

* Walking the Long Road means we need to balance the need to serve the needs of others and become experts in problem solving. 
* The time spent on fixes (refactors) when you have changed directions suddenly (veered) that cannot be learned in  any otehr way.

**Action**

* In the next 24 hours, think of an opportunity to do something useful rather than beautiful. 

#### Sustainable Motivations

**Context**

* Though you must develop your technical skills, you will often find yourself in the realities of 
customers shifting and conflicting demands.

**Problem**

* Working in real world projects takes a lot of effort(it's sometimes tedious, exhausting, and frustrating). 

**Solution**

* Find what keeps you going. Though the money may be good, it is better to value education and experience. Where you can make
a difference and make useful things. Contribute to open source and be the best version of yourself in developing programs. 
* *Do what you what you love and the money will follow*

**Action**

* Write down 5 most important things that motivates you. 

#### Nurture Your Passion

**Context**

* You have been hired as "just" a software developer.

**Problem**

* You work in an enviroment that doesn't give you much room to breath.

**Solution**

* Find local user groups that focuses on something you enjoy. 
* Read about what you love. Practice what interests you. 
* Set boundaries that define the sort of environment you're willing to work in. 
* "Try to keep the sense of wonder about programming that you had at age 14. 
If you're worried that your current job is rotting your brain, it probably is."

**Action**

* On your way to work prepare 3 positive ideas to talk about. During the day if the 
conversation starts to drain your energy, try shifting it to one of these 3 topics.

#### Draw Your Own Map

**Context**

* Any given employer can offer only a limited subset of all possible career path.

**Problem**

* None of the career paths your employer provides fits for you.

**Solution**

* "Identify a logical but ambitious next step for your career". It's not up to anyone else but you. 
* Like in agile development, do little increments as you may make changes quickly in case you make any mistakes. 

**Action**

* Rather than writing down high-level goals, try to define small, achievable steps.
* Don't let the companies or people stand in your way of learning what you want to learn. 

#### Use Your Title

**Context**

* You have been promoted

**Problem**

* You don't feel qualified enough. 

**Solution**

* Don't allow your title to affect you (so hard if you're just beginning)
* Don't be fooled by an impressive title, your apprenticeship isn't over. 

**Action**

* Write down a descriptive version of your job title. Reevaluate it from time to time. What do you think?

#### Stay in the Trenches

*Seduces by the siren song of a consumerist, quick-fix society, we sometimes choose a course of action that brings only the illusion of accomplishment, the shadow of satisfaciton*

**Context**

* You're able to deliver software due to your effort and dedication.

**Problem**

* You're given a job that will pull you away from programming.

**Solution**

* The more days you go without practicing programming the longer it will take you to become a master at it.
A promotion to management may not be what you want. 

**Action**

* Negotiate with your employer when that reward (promotion) comes. In case you want to stay in the trenches. 

#### A Different Road

**Context**

* You have used Draw Your Own Map and followed it dilligently.

**Problem**

* The map you've drawn leads you away from The Lond Road.

**Solution**

* Use what you learned as an apprentice to your new "road" (path).

**Action**

* If not software development, then what would you do? write it down, talk to people who are doing it 
and ask them what they love about it and compare it with programming.
